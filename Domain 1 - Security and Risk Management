The Primary goals and objectives of Security are contained with the CIA triad

Confidentiality
This is the first principle of CIA triad. Confidentiality means offering a high level of assurance that the
data, objects or resources are restricted from unauthorized subjects.
Numerous Countermeasures like data encryption, network traffic padding, strict access control,
rigorous authentication procedures, data classification and extensive personal training can help
ensure confidentiality against any possible threats.
One word for Confidentiality is SECRECY (Secret)
Numerous attacks that violated confidentiality includes:
Capturing network traffic, stealing password files, port scanning, social engineering, shoulder surfing,
eavesdropping and sniffing.

Integrity
Integrity is the concept of protecting the reliability and correctness of data. It ensures that the data
remains correct, unaltered and preserved.
Integrity is dependent on confidentiality.
Numerous attacks that violates Integrity includes:
Viruses, logic bombs, unauthorized access, errors in coding and applications, malicious modification,
intentional replacements and system back doors.

Availability:
ensures that information is available when needed
===========================================================================

The five elements of AAA

Identification: Identification isthe process by which a subject professes an identity and accountability
is initiated. A subject must provide an identity to a system to start the process of authentication,
Authorization and accountability (AAA). Identification could be username, smart card or scan device
etc.

Authentication: The process of verifying or testing that the claimed identity is a valid authentication.
The most common form of authentication is using a password (This includes PIN or PASSPHRASE).
Identification and authentication is often used together as a single two-stepprocess.

Authorization: Once a subject is authenticated, access must be authorized. The process of
authorization ensures that the requested activity or access to an object is possible given the rights and
privileges assigned to the authenticated identity. Example: User may be able to read a file but not
delete it, print a document but not alter it.

Auditing: Auditing or monitoring is the programmatic means by which a subject’s actions are tracked
and recorded for the purpose of holding the subject accountable for the actions while authenticated
on a system. Monitoring is part of what is needed for audits and audit logs are part of monitoring
system. Monitoring is a type of watching or oversight while auditing is a recording of the information
into a record or file. It is possible to monitor without auditing, but you can’t audit without some form
of monitoring.

Accountability: An organisations security policy can be properly enforced only if accountability is
maintained. Accountability is established by linking a human to the activities of an online identity
through the security services and mechanism of auditing, authorization, authentication and
identification.

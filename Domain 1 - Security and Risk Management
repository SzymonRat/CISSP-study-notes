The Primary goals and objectives of Security are contained with the CIA triad

Confidentiality
This is the first principle of CIA triad. Confidentiality means offering a high level of assurance that the
data, objects or resources are restricted from unauthorized subjects.
Numerous Countermeasures like data encryption, network traffic padding, strict access control,
rigorous authentication procedures, data classification and extensive personal training can help
ensure confidentiality against any possible threats.
One word for Confidentiality is SECRECY (Secret)
Numerous attacks that violated confidentiality includes:
Capturing network traffic, stealing password files, port scanning, social engineering, shoulder surfing,
eavesdropping and sniffing.

Integrity
Integrity is the concept of protecting the reliability and correctness of data. It ensures that the data
remains correct, unaltered and preserved.
Integrity is dependent on confidentiality.
Numerous attacks that violates Integrity includes:
Viruses, logic bombs, unauthorized access, errors in coding and applications, malicious modification,
intentional replacements and system back doors.

Availability:
ensures that information is available when needed
===========================================================================

The five elements of AAA

Identification: Identification isthe process by which a subject professes an identity and accountability
is initiated. A subject must provide an identity to a system to start the process of authentication,
Authorization and accountability (AAA). Identification could be username, smart card or scan device
etc.

Authentication: The process of verifying or testing that the claimed identity is a valid authentication.
The most common form of authentication is using a password (This includes PIN or PASSPHRASE).
Identification and authentication is often used together as a single two-stepprocess.

Authorization: Once a subject is authenticated, access must be authorized. The process of
authorization ensures that the requested activity or access to an object is possible given the rights and
privileges assigned to the authenticated identity. Example: User may be able to read a file but not
delete it, print a document but not alter it.

Auditing: Auditing or monitoring is the programmatic means by which a subject’s actions are tracked
and recorded for the purpose of holding the subject accountable for the actions while authenticated
on a system. Monitoring is part of what is needed for audits and audit logs are part of monitoring
system. Monitoring is a type of watching or oversight while auditing is a recording of the information
into a record or file. It is possible to monitor without auditing, but you can’t audit without some form
of monitoring.

Accountability: An organisations security policy can be properly enforced only if accountability is
maintained. Accountability is established by linking a human to the activities of an online identity
through the security services and mechanism of auditing, authorization, authentication and
identification.

Protection mechanism

Protection mechanism are common characteristics of security controls

Layering: Layering is also known as defence in depth and is the simple use of multiple controls in a
series. Using Layering in series rather than in parallel is important. Think of physical entrances to
buildings. A parallel configuration is used forshopping malls asthere are many doorsin many locations
around the entire perimeter of the mall. A series configuration would most likely be used in a bank or
airport. A single entrance is provided, and that entrance is several gateways or checkpoints that must
be passed in sequential order to gain entry into active area of thebuilding.

Abstraction: Abstraction is used for efficiency. The concept of abstraction is used when classifying
objects or assigning roles to subjects. Abstraction is used to define what types of data an object can
contain, what types of functions can be performed on or by that object and what capabilities that
object has. Abstraction simplifies security by enabling you to assign security controls to a group of
objects collected by type or function.

Data Hiding: Data hiding is preventing data from being discovered or accessed by a subject by
positioning the data in a logical storage compartment that is not accessible or seen by the subject.
Preventing an application from accessing hardware directly is also form of data hiding. Data hiding is
often key elements in security controls as well as in programming. The term security through
obscurity may seem relevant here however the concept is different. Data hiding is the act of
intentionally positioning data so that it is not viewable or accessible to an unauthorized subject.,
while Security through obscurity is the idea of not informing a subject about an object being present
and thus hoping that the subject will not discover the object. Example Security through
obscurity is when a programmer is aware of a flaw in their software code, but they release the
product anyway hoping that no one discovers the issue and exploitit.

===========================================================================================

Security Boundaries
A security boundary is the line of intersection between any two areas, subnets or environment. A
security boundary exists between a high security area and a low security one such as between LAN
and internet.

============================================================================================
Security governance is the collection of practices related to supporting, defining, and directing the
security efforts of an organization.

Security management planning ensures proper creation, implementation, and enforcement of a
security policy. We can distinguish 3 types of security planning:

a) Strategic plan- long term, defines a security purpose of the organization
b) Tactical plan: midterm, provides more details for the goals set in strategic plan e.g acquistion plna,,hiring plan,budget plan,support plan, maintenance plan
c) Operation plan: short term e.g training plan, system development plan
======================================================================================================

Organization roles and responsibilities:

1. Senior management: Responsible fro success or failure of the security of the organization as well as for exercising due care and due diligence

2. Security profesional: has function responsibility for security what includes writing and implementing security policies, but they are not decision
makes - they are implementers

3. Data owner: responsible for data classification

4. Data custodian: responsible for implementing security solution approved by policies and senior managament

5. User

6. Auditor: responsible for reviewing and veryfing that security policies are properly implemented
